# EDA-mini-project-
Exploratory Data Analysis on Company Datasets
Exploratory data analysis (EDA for short) is what data analysts do with large sets of data, looking for patterns and summarizing the dataset’s main characteristics beyond what they learn from modeling and hypothesis testing. EDA is a philosophy that allows data analysts to approach a database without assumptions. When a data analyst employs EDA, it’s like they’re asking the data to tell them what they don’t know.

It is an approach to data analysis, that uses these techniques:

Maximize insights into a dataset.
Uncover underlying structures.
Extract important variables.
Detect outliers and anomalies.
Test underlying assumptions.
Determine optimal factor settings

Outline of Project:-

	<2>  Import and Install all the libraries
	<3>  Perform data preparation & cleaning
	<4>  Ask & answer questions about the data
	<5>  Perform exploratory analysis & visualization
	<6>  Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion
